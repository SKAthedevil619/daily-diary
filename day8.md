*Day*: Wednesday  
*Day Number*: 8  

*Tasks Done*:  
- Worked on Bootstrap: created cards, modals, and alerts.  
- Built a contact form using Bootstrap's layout and components.  
- Started learning React.js basics, focusing on component creation and JSX.  

*Notes*:  
- Bootstrap is very helpful for quick UI design, but understanding its classes and structure is key.  
- React feels quite different, and Iâ€™ll need to understand its component-based architecture better.
