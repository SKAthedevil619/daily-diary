*Day*: Tuesday  
*Day Number*: 7  

*Tasks Done*:  
- Explored more JavaScript (ES6+): promises, destructuring, and template literals.  
- Created a basic form using JavaScript for validation (required fields, email formats).  
- Introduced to Bootstrap for UI components and styling.  

*Notes*:  
- Bootstrap seems to simplify many tasks, but I'll need practice integrating it with React.  
- JavaScript validation was a bit tricky, but I managed to implement it.
