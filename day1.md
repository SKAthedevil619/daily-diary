*Day*: Monday  
*Day Number*: 1  

*Tasks Done*:  
- Introduction to the company, work environment, and project structure.  
- Overview of the tools and technologies to be used (React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript).  
- Set up the development environment (installed necessary software, IDE, libraries for React).  
- Basics of HTML5: Created a simple static webpage, focusing on structuring content with semantic elements.  

*Notes*:  
- The first day was mostly introductory, but I managed to set up my workspace and begin working on basic static web pages. React.js will be the core framework, so Iâ€™ll need to brush up on its features.
