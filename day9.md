*Day Number*: 9  

*Tasks Done*:  
- Deep dive into React.js: created reusable components, learned about props and state.  
- Used React hooks (useState) to manage component state in a small project.  
- Created a dynamic habit tracker that allows users to add, edit, and delete habits.  

*Notes*:  
- Managing state in React can get complicated, but hooks make it more intuitive.  
- The habit tracker project was a good introduction to dynamic UI creation.
